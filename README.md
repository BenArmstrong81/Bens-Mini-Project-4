# Ben's-Mini-Project-4

## Your Task

The obejective of this mini project was to creat a game using JavaScript and Web APIs.

## Acceptance Criteria
The completed application should meet the following criteria:
* As a user, I want to start the game by clicking on a button. 
* As a user, I want to try and guess a word by filling in a number of blanks that match the number of letters in that word.
* As a user, I want the game to be timed. 
* As a user, I want to win the game when I have guessed all the letters in the word.
* As a user, I want to lose the game when the timer runs out before I have guessed all the letters.
* As a user, I want to see my total wins and losses on the screen. 
* When a user presses a letter key, the user's guess should be captured as a key event.
* When a user correctly guesses a letter, the corresponding blank "_" should be replaced by the letter. For example, if the user correctly selects "a", then "a _ _ a _" should appear. 
* When a user wins or loses a game, a message should appear and the timer should stop. 
* When a user clicks the start button, the timer should reset. 
* When a user refreshes or returns to the brower page, the win and loss counts should persist.

## What I Learned
We expanded on JavaScript this week.
  
With a focus on; DOM, setting attributes, appending, timer intervals, event listeners, bubblings, local storage and keyboard events. 

## What Problems Did we Solve?
I created a HTML, CSS JavaScript and README file from scratch. 
  
This was our 4th week and having a Christmas Break inbetween gave me the time to catchup and really take note of the previous few weeks and study where I struggled. This afforded me the ability at least follow along.
